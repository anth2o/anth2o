# Software engineer

I work as a Software Engineer in the pyjimmy team.

pyjimmy is an internal python library that is used by almost all the employees at Jimmy. The idea behind this library is to use Python and Git to store, connect, and use technical data about our nuclear reactor.

The main features I develop in pyjimmy are:

* document generation: I develop python methods that can be used by my colleagues to write documents in python so that they can use technical data, visualizing those documents in a web interface, and generating them as PDFs.
* developing a web app to explore the technical data stored as python code. On this feature I'm working on every aspects: the backend with FastAPI, the frontend with React and the deployment with Docker / Github Actions / AWS
* implementing Github Actions workflows to help my colleagues estimate the impact of their modifications when they create a Pull Request

An other aspect of my role is also to help my colleagues that are not software engineers to use the library we're developping, and also more generally using git and python.
