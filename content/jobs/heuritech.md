# Computer Vision Engineer

I worked as Computer Vision Engineer 3 years at Heuritech, first as an intern and then full-time.

My main task as a computer vision engineer was to implement and improve existing deep learning models with tensorflow. Those models were performing:
- object detection (using Faster-RCNN)
- color detection (using CNN and attention mechanism)
- multiclass and multi-label classification (using CNN)
        
I also implemented evaluation procedure of our computer vision pipeline to generate actionable insights for the business team.
    
As a software engineer, I maintained the team's repository by:
- setting up and maintaining a CI that performed: docker image building, unit testing with coverage computation, linting, documentation generation and upload...
- implementing documentation generation using Sphinx
- managing the life cycle of our docker images
- managing the mono repository internal dependencies using Poetry
