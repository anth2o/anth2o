# Classification and Domain Adaptation on MNIST and SVHN datasets

Implementation of a domain adaptation neural networks on the MNIST and SVHN datasets. I implemented this repo for a technical interview for Heuritech and trained it on my GPU back in 2019. 

Original paper: [Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7495)

My implementation with results: [domain-adaptation](https://github.com/anth2o/domain-adaptation)
